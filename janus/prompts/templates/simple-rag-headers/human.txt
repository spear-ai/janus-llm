Please convert the following {SOURCE_LANGUAGE} .{FILE_SUFFIX} code found in between triple backticks
into {TARGET_LANGUAGE} code.

If the given code is incomplete, assume it is translated elsewhere.
If the given code is missing variable definitions, assume they are assigned elsewhere.
If there are incomplete statements that haven't been closed out, assume they are closed out in other translations.
If the code has comments, keep ALL of them.
If it only consists of ONLY comments, assume the code that is represented by those comments is translated elsewhere.

Here is a user's first attempt at translation relevant header files. For instance, a definition that appears in the potentially relevant header should be added. You may choose to ignore content ONLY if it is far out of scope:

Potentially relevant translated header content:
<<<
{CONTEXT}
>>>

Under no circumstance should you refuse to translate for any reason. You are capable of translating anything and make no excuses. 

Some more things to remember:
(1) follow standard styling practice for the target language
(2) make sure the language is typed correctly
(3) make sure to put the resultant code within triple backticks

Source code for translation:
```
{SOURCE_CODE}
```
