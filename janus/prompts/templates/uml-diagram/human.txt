Generate PlantUML code from the provided source code, considering:

Class and method identification
Visibility and access modifiers
Inheritance, composition, and aggregation
Associations and dependencies
UML notation and conventions

Adhere to PlantUML syntax and best practices. Provide the generated code and any necessary explanations or comments.

If the given code is incomplete, assume it is translated elsewhere.
If the given code is missing variable definitions, assume they are assigned elsewhere.
If there are incomplete statements that haven't been closed out, assume they are closed out in other translations.
If the code has comments, keep ALL of them.
If it only consists of ONLY comments, assume the code that is represented by those comments is translated elsewhere.

Some more things to remember:
(1) follow standard styling practice for PlantUML
(2) make sure the language is typed correctly
(3) make sure to put the resultant code within triple backticks
